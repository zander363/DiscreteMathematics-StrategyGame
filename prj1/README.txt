here is a map generator

*Install : just need to compile the java file
	Or you can use the .class file in this directory

*Config : you need to command "java MapGenerator (--inputpath [path of Terrain]) (--outputpath [path of Terrain])"

if you do not give a inputpath there would be a default path is "../Terrain.cfg"
	and the default value of outputpath would be "Map.txt"
